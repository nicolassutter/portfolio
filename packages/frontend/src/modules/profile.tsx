  bio: `I am currently a **freelance full-stack software engineer** after 5 years of full-time web dev and a year as a **Lead Developer**.


I love to discover new technologies (and the JS ecosystem changes every 2 minutes, so that's nice I guess üôÉ).

I also love making pizzas, but I am not sure it is relevant here. üçï

On a more serious note, I am passionate about software and hardware as I love to solve problems and build things.

I currently host my own home media server on Docker with Caddy and a whole lot of open source projets.

I am looking for missions or full-time jobs opportunitites based on **React, Vue.js or SolidJS (‚ù§Ô∏è),  Node.js and TypeScript.**

I believe to be a good fit for a team that values quality, performance and maintainability; especially with all the JS based tech coming out these days.`,
