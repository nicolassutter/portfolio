  bio: `I am currently a freelance full-stack developer living in Strasbourg, France.
I love to discover new technologies (and the JS ecosystem changes every 2 minutes, so that's nice I guess üôÉ).
I also repair printers for my family as all developers do obviously, and I game on my free time.

On a more serious note, I am passionate about web development and I am always looking for new challenges.

I am looking for missions mostly based on React, Vue.js or SolidJS (‚ù§Ô∏è), Node.js and TypeScript.
I believe to be a good fit for a team that values quality, performance and maintainability; especially with all the JS based tech coming out these days.`,
