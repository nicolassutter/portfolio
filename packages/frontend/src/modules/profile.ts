  bio: `I am currently a technical supervisor and a full-stack developer working at AlsacrÃ©ations, living in Strasbourg, France.
I love to discover new technologies (and the JS ecosystem changes every 2 minutes, so that's nice I guess ðŸ™ƒ).
I also repair printers for my family as all developers do obviously, and I game on my free time.`,
