This is a small job application tracker that helps me track my applications to different jobs, it also provides useful statistics about the applications I've made. Although sadly, the statistics are not very positive considering the market in 2025... Anyhow I built the app on a Tanstack Router based app with Pocketbase for auth and a custom h3 + tRPC server for the backend.
