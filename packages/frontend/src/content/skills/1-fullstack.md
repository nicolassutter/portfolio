Proficient in full-stack development with modern technologies such as TypeScript, Nuxt, Next, and Drizzle. Nowadays all major front-end framework have a similar syntax and somewhat similar ways to think about problems, so switching from one framework to another is not a problem.
I also use Golang on some projects, although mostly to interact with Pocketbase's already defined APIs.
